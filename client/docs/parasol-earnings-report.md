Acme Corp and Globex Inc remain top contributors to revenue, together representing
65% of total billings. Acme Corp showed strong adoption of new cloud packages, while
Globex Inc continues to rely heavily on enterprise licensing. Soylent Corp, while
representing a smaller share, maintains a consistent revenue stream from legacy
products. Customer churn remains below 5%, an industry-leading figure.

shown particularly strong performance, with 90% renewal rates projected. The pipeline
health index remains at 0.82, indicating a well-balanced mix of early, mid, and
late-stage deals. The closed opportunities show a natural decline due to the phase-out
of legacy contracts, aligning with corporate strategy.


## Support Case Analysis

A total of 6 support cases were logged during this reporting period. 50% of cases were

performance incidents. Median resolution time improved by 12% compared to FY2024,
highlighting operational efficiencies in the support organization.


## Year-over-Year Comparisons

operating margins. Customer satisfaction scores increased from 86 to 89, driven by
faster response times and product stability. Churn rates decreased by 1.5 points
compared to FY2024, largely attributed to proactive engagement programs.


## Operational Metrics

SLA compliance improved to 98.5%, with major incidents handled within contractual
windows. First-contact resolution rates increased to 72%, up from 65% last year. The
support team has invested in automation and self-service capabilities, reducing
average case handling time from 4.5 hours to 3.8 hours.


## Future Outlook

Parasol Cloud Corp is positioned for strong growth in FY2026, with plans to expand
into three new regional markets and introduce AI-powered analytics capabilities. The
sales team is focused on deepening relationships with existing enterprise clients while
pursuing net-new accounts in the financial services sector.
